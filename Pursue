2. Rewrite handle_reg.php so that it uses a variable for the current year,
   instead of hard-coding that value.

3. For debugging purposes, add code to the beginning of the handle_reg.php
   script that prints out the values of the received variables. Hint:
   There’s a short and a long way to do this.

For 2 and 3, see handle_reg#1.php

4. Rewrite one of the versions of handle_reg.php so that it prints the
   user’s favorite color selection in the user’s favorite color.
   Hint: You’ll want to use CSS and concatenation.

For 4, see handle_reg#2.php

5. Update handle_reg.php so that it validates the user’s birthday by looking
   at the three individual form elements: month, day, and year.

   Create a variable that represents the user’s birthday in the format
   XX/DD/YYYY (again, you’ll use concatenation for this).

For 5, see handle_reg#3.php
