Q1 Why is it important to have a user confirm their password during the
   registration process?
A  An HTML form commonly prompts for a user password without displaying
   the actual password, for security reasons.

   Prompting for the password twice ensures that the user types the same
   password twice.

Q2A What is the basic structure of an if conditional in PHP?
A   The basic structure of an if conditional is:

    if (conditional) {
        // If conditional is TRUE, execute:
        one (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon
    }

Q2B An if-else conditional?
A   The basic structure of an if-else conditional is:

    if (conditional) {
        // If conditional is TRUE, execute:
        one (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon
    } else {
        // If conditional is FALSE, execute:
        one (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon
    }

Q2C An if-elseif?
A   The basic structure of an if-elseif is:

    if (conditional1) {
        // If conditional1 is TRUE, execute:
        one (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon
    } else if (conditional2) {
        // Otherwise, if conditional2 is TRUE, execute:
        one (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon
    }

Q2D An if-elseif-else?
A   The basic structure of an if-elseif-else is:

    if (conditional1) {
        // If conditional1 is TRUE, execute:
        one (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon
    } else if (conditional2) {
        // Otherwise, if conditional2 is TRUE, execute:
        one (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon
    } else {
        // Otherwise, execute:
        one (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon
    }

Q3 What are the differences between the empty() and isset() functions?
A  The empty() function returns TRUE if a variable is not set, the value
   of the variable is 0 or an empty or NULL string. Otherwise, it returns
   FALSE.

   The isset function returns TRUE if a variable is set and not NULL.
   Otherwise, it returns FALSE.

Q4 What is the assignment operator? What is the equality operator?
A  A single equals (=) is the assignment operator. A double equals (==)
   is the equality operator.

Q5 Without knowing anything about $var, will the following conditional be TRUE
   or FALSE? Why?

   if ($var = 'donut') {

A  The value will be TRUE since the conditional in the if statement is
   using the assigment operator.

Q6 What do these operators mean?

   && 
   ||
   !

A  All of those operators are logical operators:

   && => Logical AND
   || => Logical OR
   !  => Logical NOT

Q7 What is the syntax of a switch conditional? When is a switch
   most commonly used?
A  The syntax of a switch conditional is:

   switch ($variable)
   {
       case value1:
          Statements(s)1;
          break;

       case value2:
          Statement(s2);
          break;

       default:
          Statement(s) if there no matches;
          break;
   }

   A switch conditional is often used in place of an "if" conditional with
   multiple possible values.

Q8 What is the syntax of a for loop?
A  The syntax of a for loop is:

   for (<temp variable>=<starting value>; <conditional>; <operation>)
   {
       One (or more) commands, each terminated with a semi-colon;
   }

   For example, the following loop counts from 100 to 1:

   for ($i = 100; $i >= 1; $i--)
   {
       print 'The value is ' . $i;
   }
